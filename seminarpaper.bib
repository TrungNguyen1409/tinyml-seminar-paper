Since Tiny machine learning (TinyML) is a quickly evolving subject, it is crucial that internet of things (IoT) devices be able to communicate with one another for the sake of stability and future development. TinyML is a rapidly growing subfield at the intersection of computer science, software engineering, and machine learning. Building deep learning (DL) networks that are a few hundred KBs in size has been the focus of recent research in this area. Deploying TinyML into small devices makes them smart. Reduced computation, power usage, and response time are just a few of the many advantages of TinyML. In this work, we provide an introduction to TinyML and demonstrate its benefits and architecture. Then, we investigate the meaning of quantization as a standard compression method for TinyML-related applications. There are two methods used to obtain the quantized weights of the deep learning models are quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ), we described them in details. Next, TinyML-based solutions to improve the role of IoT devices in Smart Cities are highlighted as: lightweight training of deep learning models, inference of lightweight deep learning models in IoT devices, low power consumption, and inference of deep learning models in restricted resources of IoT devices. Finally, presenting some use cases for TinyML studies, with these studies applied to several cases in a variety of fields. To the best of the author’s knowledge, few studies have investigated TinyML as it is an emerging field.},

	abstract = {Standard-size autonomous navigation vehicles have rapidly improved thanks to the breakthroughs of deep learning. However, scaling autonomous driving to low-power systems deployed on dynamic environments poses several challenges that prevent their adoption. To address them, we propose a closed-loop learning flow for autonomous driving mini-vehicles that includes the target environment in-the-loop. We leverage a family of compact and high-throughput tinyCNNs to control the mini-vehicle, which learn in the target environment by imitating a computer vision algorithm, i.e., the expert. Thus, the tinyCNNs, having only access to an on-board fast-rate linear camera, gain robustness to lighting conditions and improve over time. Further, we leverage GAP8, a parallel ultra-low-power RISC-V SoC, to meet the inference requirements. When running the family of CNNs, our GAP8's solution outperforms any other implementation on the STM32L4 and NXP k64f (Cortex-M4), reducing the latency by over 13x and the energy consummation by 92\%.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) theory, particularly deep learning neural networks, robot vacuums equipped with AI power can automatically clean indoor floors by using intelligent programming and vacuuming services. To date, several deep AI models have been proposed to distinguish indoor objects between cleanable litter and noncleanable hazardous obstacles. Unfortunately, these existing deep AI models focus entirely on the accuracy enhancement of object classification, and little effort has been made to minimize the memory size and implementation cost of AI models. As a result, these existing deep AI models require far more memory space than a typical robot vacuum can provide. To address this shortcoming, this paper aims to study and find an efficient deep AI model that can achieve a good balance between classification accuracy and memory usage (i.e., implementation cost). In this work, we propose a weight-quantized SqueezeNet model for robot vacuums. This model can classify indoor cleanable litters from noncleanable hazardous obstacles based on the image or video captures from robot vacuums. Furthermore, we collect videos or pictures captured by built-in cameras of robot vacuums and use them to construct a diverse dataset. The dataset contains 20,000 images with a ground-view perspective of dining rooms, kitchens and living rooms for various houses under different lighting conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed deep AI model can achieve comparable object classification accuracy of around 93\% while reducing memory usage by at least 22.5 times. More importantly, the memory footprint required by our AI model is only 0.8 MB, indicating that this model can run smoothly on resource-constrained robot vacuums, where low-end processors or microcontrollers are dedicated to running AI algorithms.},

This paper proposes an architecture for detection of alphabets in American Sign Language on an ARM Cortex-M7 microcontroller having just 496 KB of framebuffer RAM. Leveraging parameter quantization is a common technique that might cause varying drops in test accuracy. This paper proposes using interpolation as augmentation amongst other techniques as an efficient method of reducing this drop, which also helps the model generalize well to previously unseen noisy data. The proposed model is about 185 KB post-quantization and inference speed is 20 frames per second.},

	abstract = {Focusing on comprehensive networking, the Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) facilitates efficiency and robustness in factory operations. Various intelligent sensors play a central role, as they generate a vast amount of real-time data that can provide insights into manufacturing. Complex event processing (CEP) and machine learning (ML) have been developed actively in the last years in IIoT to identify patterns in heterogeneous data streams and fuse raw data into tangible facts. In a traditional compute-centric paradigm, the raw field data are continuously sent to the cloud and processed centrally. As IIoT devices become increasingly pervasive, concerns are raised since transmitting such an amount of data is energy-intensive, vulnerable to be intercepted, and subjected to high latency. Decentralized on-device ML and CEP provide a solution where data is processed primarily on edge devices. Thus communications can be minimized. However, this is no mean feat because most IIoT edge devices are resource-constrained with low power consumption. This paper proposes a framework that exploits ML and CEP's synergy at the edge in distributed sensor networks. By leveraging tiny ML and μCEP, we now shift the computation from the cloud to the resource-constrained IIoT devices and allow users to adapt on-device ML models and CEP reasoning rules flexibly on the fly. Lastly, we demonstrate the proposed solution and show its effectiveness and feasibility using an industrial use case of machine safety monitoring.},

In this work, a comprehensive review of the novel TinyML ecosystem is provided. The related challenges and opportunities are identified and the potential services that will be enabled by the development of truly smart frugal objects are discussed. As a main contribution of this paper, a detailed survey of the available TinyML frameworks for integrating ML algorithms within MCUs is provided. Besides, aiming at illustrating the given discussion, a real case study is presented. Concretely, we propose a multi-Radio Access Network (RAT) architecture for smart frugal objects. The issue of selecting the most adequate communication interface for sending sporadic messages considering both the status of the device and the characteristics of the data to be sent is addressed. To this end, several TinyML frameworks are evaluated and the performances of a number of ML algorithms embedded in an Arduino Uno board are analyzed. The attained results reveal the validity of the TinyML approach, which successfully enables the integration of techniques such as Neural Networks (NNs), Support Vector Machine (SVM), decision trees, or Random Forest (RF) in frugal objects with constrained hardware resources. The outcomes also show promising results in terms of algorithm's accuracy and computation performance.},

	abstract = {Currently, the applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) generate a large amount of sensor data at a very high pace, making it a challenge to collect and store the data. This scenario brings about the need for effective data compression algorithms to make the data manageable among tiny and battery-powered devices and, more importantly, shareable across the network. Additionally, considering that, very often, wireless communications (e.g., low-power wide-area networks) are adopted to connect field devices, user payload compression can also provide benefits derived from better spectrum usage, which in turn can result in advantages for high-density application scenarios. As a result of this increase in the number of connected devices, a new concept has emerged, called TinyML. It enables the use of machine learning on tiny, computationally restrained devices. This allows intelligent devices to analyze and interpret data locally and in real time. Therefore, this work presents a new data compression solution (algorithm) for the IoT that leverages the TinyML perspective. The new approach is called the Tiny Anomaly Compressor (TAC) and is based on data eccentricity. TAC does not require previously established mathematical models or any assumptions about the underlying data distribution. In order to test the effectiveness of the proposed solution and validate it, a comparative analysis was performed on two real-world datasets with two other algorithms from the literature (namely Swing Door Trending (SDT) and the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)). It was found that the TAC algorithm showed promising results, achieving a maximum compression rate of 98.33\%. Additionally, it also surpassed the two other models regarding the compression error and peak signal-to-noise ratio in all cases.},

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is widely used in precision agriculture as Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have brought a huge volume of data to exploit to provide useful insights for farmers such as weather prediction, pest development detection, or harvest time estimation. AI algorithms are mostly executed in the cloud due to their inherent computing constraints, thus requiring the different sensors to offload their data to the appropriate server. Depending on the amount and volume of data exchanged, the need for computer offloading may induce privacy, security, and latency issues in addition to weighting on the sensor’s battery consumption as wireless transmission methods have a high-energy demand. To overcome this difficulty, recent research has tried to bring AI computation closer to the end device with edge or fog computing and more recently with the Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) paradigm that aims to embed the AI algorithm directly into the sensor’s microcontroller. In that context, this paper proposes a prototype of smart sensor capable of detecting fruits presence with TinyML. We then study the energy consumption of our system in different IoT scenarios.},

Conventional ML approaches usually need significant computational resources to attain the intended level of precision, thereby restricting their feasibility to high-capacity hardware including network nodes. A paradigm shift has occurred with the emergence of Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML), enabling ML tasks to be run on Internet of Things (IoT) hardware with severe limitations. The TinyML paradigm advocates the integration of ML-based processes into small devices powered by microcontroller units (MCUs). This article begins with an introduction to TinyML and then explains the tools that support it. We provide up-to-date information about TinyML frameworks. Subsequently, the most recent TinyML apps that use cutting-edge technology are discussed. Finally, several research problems and potential future directions are noted.},

AI is now used in a plethora of research areas and has demonstrated its capability to bring new approaches and solutions to various research problems. However, the extensive computation required to train AI algorithms comes with a cost. Driven by the need to reduce the energy consumption, the carbon footprint and the cost of computers running machine learning algorithms, TinyML is nowadays considered as a promising AI alternative focusing on technologies and applications for extremely low-profile devices. This paper presents the results of a literature survey of all TinyML applications and related research efforts.

	abstract = {Tiny machine learning (TinyML) is a fast-growing research area committed to democratizing deep learning for all-pervasive microcontrollers (MCUs). Challenged by the constraints on power, memory, and computation, TinyML has achieved significant advancement in the last few years. However, the current TinyML solutions are based on batch/offline settings and support only the neural network's inference on MCUs. The neural network is first trained using a large amount of pre-collected data on a powerful machine and then flashed to MCUs. This results in a static model, hard to adapt to new data, and impossible to adjust for different scenarios, which impedes the flexibility of the Internet of Things (IoT). To address these problems, we propose a novel system called TinyOL (TinyML with Online-Learning), which enables incremental on-device training on streaming data. TinyOL is based on the concept of online learning and is suitable for constrained IoT devices. We experiment TinyOL under supervised and unsupervised setups using an autoencoder neural network. Finally, we report the performance of the proposed solution and show its effectiveness and feasibility.},

	abstract = {Tiny machine learning (TinyML) has gained widespread popularity where machine learning (ML) is democratized on ubiquitous microcontrollers, processing sensor data everywhere in real-time. To manage TinyML in the industry, where mass deployment happens, we consider the hardware and software constraints, ranging from available onboard sensors and memory size to ML-model architectures and runtime platforms. However, Internet of Things (IoT) devices are typically tailored to specific tasks and are subject to heterogeneity and limited resources. Moreover, TinyML models have been developed with different structures and are often distributed without a clear understanding of their working principles, leading to a fragmented ecosystem. Considering these challenges, we propose a framework using Semantic Web technologies to enable the joint management of TinyML models and IoT devices at scale, from modeling information to discovering possible combinations and benchmarking, and eventually facilitate TinyML component exchange and reuse. We present an ontology (semantic schema) for neural network models aligned with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Thing Description, which semantically describes IoT devices. Furthermore, a Knowledge Graph of 23 publicly available ML models and six IoT devices were used to demonstrate our concept in three case studies, and we shared the code and examples to enhance reproducibility: https://github.com/Haoyu-R/How-to-Manage-TinyML-at-Scale},

	abstract = {Recent advances in Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) empower low-footprint embedded devices for real-time on-device Machine Learning (ML). While many acknowledge the potential benefits of TinyML, its practical implementation presents unique challenges. This study aims to bridge the gap between prototyping single TinyML models and developing reliable TinyML systems in production: (1) Embedded devices operate in dynamically changing conditions. Existing TinyML solutions primarily focus on inference, with models trained offline on powerful machines and deployed as static objects. However, static models may underperform in the real world due to evolving input data distributions. We propose online learning to enable training on constrained devices, adapting local models toward the latest field conditions. (2) Nevertheless, current on-device learning methods struggle with heterogeneous deployment conditions and the scarcity of labeled data when applied across numerous devices. We introduce federated meta-learning incorporating online learning to enhance model generalization, facilitating rapid learning. This approach ensures optimal performance among distributed devices by knowledge sharing. (3) Moreover, TinyML’s pivotal advantage is widespread adoption. Embedded devices and TinyML models prioritize extreme efficiency, leading to diverse characteristics ranging from memory and sensors to model architectures. Given their diversity and non-standardized representations, managing these resources becomes challenging as TinyML systems scale up. We present semantic management for the joint management of models and devices at scale. We demonstrate our methods through a basic regression example and then assess them in three real-world TinyML applications: handwritten character image classification, keyword audio classification, and smart building presence detection. The results confirm the effectiveness of our approaches from various perspectives, such as accuracy improvement, resource savings, and engineering effort reduction.},

	abstract = {Empowering the Internet of Things devices with Artificial Intelligence capabilities can transform all vertical applications domains within the next few years. Current approaches favor hosting Machine Learning (ML) models on Linux-based single-board computers. Nevertheless, these devices’ cost and energy requirements limit the possible application scenarios. Conversely, today’s available 32-bit microcontrollers have much lower costs and only need a few milliwatts to operate, making them an energy-efficient and cost-effective alternative. However, the latter devices, usually referred to as far edge devices, have stringent resource constraints and host non-Linux-based embedded real-time operating systems. Therefore, orchestrating such devices executing portions of ML applications represents a major challenge with current tools and frameworks. This paper formally introduces the Tiny-MLOps framework as the specialization of standard ML orchestration practices, including far edge devices in the loop. To this aim, we will tailor each phase of the classical ML orchestration loop to the reduced resources available onboard typical IoT devices. We will rely on the proposed framework to deliver adaptation and evolving capabilities to resource-constrained IoT sensors mounted on an industrial rotary machine to detect anomalies. As a feasibility study, We will show how to programmatically re-deploy ML-based anomaly detection models to far edge devices. Our preliminary experiments measuring the system performance in terms of deployment, loading, and inference latency of the ML models will corroborate the usefulness of our proposal.},

	abstract = {Unforeseen failures of industrial assets may lead to unexpected downtime with a huge impact on critical business processes. Therefore, modern assets usually include several embedded sensors and processing units, allowing to monitor certain operational parameters, i.e., Condition Monitoring. The sensed data can be later analyzed using Machine Learning (ML) approaches to detect anomalies and anticipate failures. Furthermore, the Internet of Things can provide the tools to extend Condition Monitoring to legacy assets that do not have onboard sensing capabilities. In general, these IoT devices offer the opportunity to move ML processing closer to the monitored asset, thus reducing costs and simplifying the anomaly detection system. However, extreme industrial environments present harsh operating conditions and limited resources, further exacerbated by the reduced computation capabilities of most IoT devices. This paper proposes an ML-based anomaly detection system that uses a retrofitting kit based on a constrained and cost-effective IoT device. Despite its limited resources, the latter executes a state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm locally, autonomously learning the normality behavior of the monitored asset. Furthermore, to improve the transparency of the monitoring process, we propose to leverage blockchain technology as a non-repudiable repository of information, also assessing the impact of such implementation choice in terms of costs and overhead.},

	abstract = {In the era of the fourth industrial revolution, several concepts have arisen in parallel with this new revolution, such as predictive maintenance, which today plays a key role in sustainable manufacturing and production systems by introducing a digital version of machine maintenance. The data extracted from production processes have increased exponentially due to the proliferation of sensing technologies. Even if Maintenance 4.0 faces organizational, financial, or even data source and machine repair challenges, it remains a strong point for the companies that use it. Indeed, it allows for minimizing machine downtime and associated costs, maximizing the life cycle of the machine, and improving the quality and cadence of production. This approach is generally characterized by a very precise workflow, starting with project understanding and data collection and ending with the decision-making phase. This paper presents an exhaustive literature review of methods and applied tools for intelligent predictive maintenance models in Industry 4.0 by identifying and categorizing the life cycle of maintenance projects and the challenges encountered, and presents the models associated with this type of maintenance: condition-based maintenance (CBM), prognostics and health management (PHM), and remaining useful life (RUL). Finally, a novel applied industrial workflow of predictive maintenance is presented including the decision support phase wherein a recommendation for a predictive maintenance platform is presented. This platform ensures the management and fluid data communication between equipment throughout their life cycle in the context of smart maintenance.},

abstract = {The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) is driving the emergence of TinyML, a subset of ML for which models are constrained to be executed on low resource embedded devices. Currently, most IoT applications in Africa are based on cloud-centric architecture making it difficult to enjoy ML-driven intelligence due to connectivity, energy, and cost challenges making tinyML an ideal solution to such challenges. This paper presents an introduction to TinyML and discusses its general applications, solutions to concerns on the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the achievement of the sustainable development goals (SDGs), and the Information Technology for Development (ICT4D) TinyML technology requirements. TinyML applications classifications are highlighted with specific examples from Africa. Different challenges for the adoption of tinyML in Africa have also been presented with the opportunities that can arise from such challenges being shown. This paper shows how tinyML has great potential in Africa where the use of Embedded systems and AI is still underexploited.},

	abstract = {Agriculture is a high-priority sector since it creates economic opportunities and generates the majority of the world’s food. In 2050, agricultural products will be in exceptionally high demand due to a 30\% increase in the world’s population. Human resources for agriculture development are disappearing as young people migrate to major cities, while agricultural land is being abused for rapid expansion. To satisfy the food demand, the major portion of agricultural tasks must be automated. Agricultural research has revealed that the Internet of Things (IoT) technology might be the future of modern and automated agriculture research. The aforementioned technology faces a number of common obstacles, including internet requirements, data transfer, and privacy concerns. TinyML is an emerging technology that delivers low-cost and highly efficient devices capable of locally running complex machine learning models and neural networks, while overcoming the majority of the aforementioned IoT issues. As a comprehensive solution for autonomously watering plants, a TinyML-based system capable of monitoring ambient conditions and plants’ soil moisture is presented in this work.},

	abstract = {Predictive maintenance plays an important role in reducing long-term maintenance costs, unplanned downtime, and improving the lifetime of industrial machines. A common trait of machines is that they produce heat while working, resulting in a temperature pattern. Temperature can be a key parameter for monitoring the condition of machines, further aiding the diagnostics of problems. This paper presents an Internet of Things (IoT) system that monitors and detects thermal anomalies in industrial machines using deep neural networks (DNNs). The proposed system enables the DNN to run and make predictions inside a microcontroller, reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted to any external server. Furthermore, this system uses a platform that centralizes multiple sensors with the option of communicating with a server that runs two additional neural networks that are specialized in highlighting zones of interest in the thermal image and monitoring the temperature behavior over time. The system was tested in a laboratory and two industrial environments. Overall, the system performed well and can detect machine anomalies while also drastically reducing the amount of data needed to be transmitted. The system also presented high adaptability to different environments.},

	abstract = {Unplanned outage in industry due to machine failures can lead to significant production losses and increased maintenance costs. Predictive maintenance methods use the data collected from IoT-enabled devices installed in working machines to detect incipient faults and prevent major failures. In this study, a predictive maintenance system based on machine learning algorithms, specifically AdaBoost, is presented to classify different types of machines stops in real-time with application in knitting machines. The data collected from the machines include machine speeds and steps, which were pre-processed and fed into the machine learning model to classify six types of machines stops: gate stop, feeder stop, needle stop, completed roll stop, idle stop, and lycra stop. The model is trained and optimized using a combination of hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques to achieve an accuracy of 92\% on the test set. The results demonstrate the potential of the proposed system to accurately classify machine stops and enable timely maintenance actions; thereby, improving the overall efficiency and productivity of the textile industry.},

	abstract = {This article proposes a proof-of-concept device to continuously assess the usage of handheld power tools and detect construction working tasks (e.g., different drilling works) along with potential misusages, e.g., drops, with an energy-efficient architecture design. The designed device is based on Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and NFC connectivity. BLE is used to exchange data with a gateway, whereas NFC has been chosen as an energy-efficient wake-up mechanism. A temperature and humidity sensor is embedded to monitor storage conditions and an accelerometer for tool usage monitoring. The ARM Cortex-M4 core embedded in the BLE module is exploited to process the information at the edge. A Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) algorithm is proposed to process the data directly on board and achieve low latency and high energy efficiency. The TinyML algorithm has been developed embedded in the proposed device to detect four different usage classes (tool transportation, no-load, metal, and wood drilling). A dataset containing more than 280 min of three-axis accelerations during different activities has been acquired with the device attached to a construction rotary hammer drill and used to train and validate the algorithm. A neural architecture search has been performed to optimize the trade-off between accuracy and complexity, achieving an accuracy of 90.6\% with a model size of roughly 30 kB. The experimental results showed an ultralow power consumption in sleep mode of 550 nA and a peak power consumption of 8 mA while running TinyML on the edge. This results in a balanced combination of edge processing capabilities and low power consumption, enabling to obtain a smart Internet of Things (IoT) device in the field with a long lifetime of up to four years in operation and 17 years in shelf mode with a standard 250-mAh coin battery. This work enables a long battery lifetime operation of device degradation and utility analysis, further closing the gap between edge processing and fine granularity data evaluation.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an innovative deployment strategy for a power-aware and delay-aware TinyML model optimized for agricultural soil quality monitoring and management. The proposed method employs an enhanced fusion of Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), Sleep/Wake Strategies based on Genetic Algorithms, Energy Harvesting, and Task Partitioning. Through this method, the model reduces energy consumption by 8.5\% and delay by 10.4\%, while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Q Learning techniques. The proposed model also uses a Proof-of-Energy Efficiency (PoEE) based consensus for creation of new blocks. These blocks are added to different sidechains for strengthening the security levels. While blockchains require higher energy during mining, the proposed PoEE Model uses a light weight consensus, which is backed by Q Learning based sidechain formation process. This lightweighted combination allows the model to reduce delay, maintain lower energy consumption, with better communication throughput even under multiple attack scenarios. This model is necessary due to the growing demand for sustainable and accurate agricultural practices. The quality of the soil is crucial to soil yield and productivity. Monitoring and managing soil conditions enables farmers to optimize irrigation, fertilization, and overall resource allocation, leading to an increase in soil yield and a decrease in environmental impacts. However, the deployment of energy-efficient and low-latency TinyML models is essential to enable real-time decision-making in agricultural settings with limited resources. This power-aware and delay-aware TinyML model has applications in various agricultural real-time scenarios. It can be used to continuously monitor soil quality parameters including moisture content, pH level, and nutrient levels for various farm types. Incorporating sensors and low-power microcontrollers, the model enables on-site analysis and timely farmer feedbacks. The decreased energy consumption extends the battery life of deployed devices, whereas the decreased delay ensures that soil management interventions and treatments are responsive and timely for different scenarios.},
