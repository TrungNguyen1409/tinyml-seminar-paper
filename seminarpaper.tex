\begin{abstract}
In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have received tremendous amount of attention in both industry and research world. However, conventional Machine Learning demands high computing capability which limits its usage to only larger computing units. The pardigm shift to Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) is revolutionizing industries by enabling the deployment of machine learning models on low-power, resource-constrained devices. Being one of the most rapid developing field of Machine Learning, TinyML promises to benifits multiple industries. However, building a production-ready tinyML system poses different unique challenges. In this paper, we explore the key obstacles faced when developing and deploying TinyML models in production environments, including model optimization, hardware limitations, software integration, and maintaining performance in real-world conditions. Additionally, we present real-world use cases of TinyML in industrial settings, showcasing its transformative impact. We also discuss practical approaches and strategies presented by recent researches \cite{ren_tinyol_2021} to overcome these challenges, providing insights into how TinyML systems can be successfully scaled and implemented in production.

\subsection{Context and Importance of TinyML}

Traditional Machine Learning Models, especially Deep Learning Models typically require substantial amount of computing capability to operate effectively. These models are often trained on powerful Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and produce large models ranging from tens or hundreds of gigabytes (GB) down to smaller models in the range of 10 to 100 megabytes (MB). However, the memory requirements during runtime for these models far exceed what microcontrollers (MCUs) can handle.
According to a recent report \cite{noauthor_microcontroller_nodate}, as of 2021, around 31 billion Microcontroller Units (MCU) units were shipped worldwide annually. The MCU market size is projected to increase in the next years, as the market g.

\begin{equation}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\label{Pythagoras}
\end{equation}

Again, refering to this equation is easy (see Eq.~\ref{Pythagoras}).
If you do not need numbering for equations, use the {\em displaymath}
environment:

\begin{displaymath}
x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\
\end{displaymath}
