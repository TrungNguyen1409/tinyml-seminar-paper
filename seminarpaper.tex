\begin{equation}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\label{Pythagoras}
\end{equation}

Again, refering to this equation is easy (see Eq.~\ref{Pythagoras}).
If you do not need numbering for equations, use the {\em displaymath}
environment:

\begin{displaymath}
x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\
\end{displaymath}




\section{Use Cases of TinyML}

Enumerations using bullet points:

\begin{itemize}
	\item 	IoT and Smart Devices
	\item 	Environmental Monitoring
	\item 	Industrial Applications
	\item 	IoT and Smart Devices
	\item 	Edge AI and Autonomous Systems

\end{itemize}



\section{Techniques in TinyML (3-4 pages)}



\begin{quote}
	``I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.''
	(T.J. Watson, IBM, 1943)
\end{quote}

The rest of the work (especially all the regular text) must be
written/phrased by you. If you write about some results or fact
stated in another paper, you should refer to it.
The `Analytical Engine'' --- a mechanical calculation machine ---
created by Charles Babbage in the year 1838 was based on the decimal
system
